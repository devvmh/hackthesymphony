1) Install Github app from https://mac.github.com

2) Intsall XCode developer tools in the App Store or in XCode, I forget which

4) Clone the git repository with the git app: https://github.com/devvmh/hackthesymphony

5) In the github app, right click on "hackthesymphony" and select "Open in Terminal". It will open a Terminal in the correct directory.

6) Enter the following commands, one to a line. Press Enter after each one.

    cd ~/hackthesymphony #or wherever your 
    scripts/install-requirements.command
    scripts/create-database.command
    scripts/run-server.command

7) The terminal will show you error messages from the Python server, if any.

8) Use a text editor (I recommend http://www.sublimetext.com/2) to edit the Javascript/CSS/other files as needed
